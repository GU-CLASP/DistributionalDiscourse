# To Do

- additional experimental conditions: 
  - discourse markers / discourse + laughter
  - freezing the utterance encoder
  - in-domain pre-training for BERT
  - GloVe aggregation for utterances
    - BiLSTM 
    - CNN / average pool?
- methodological improvements: 
  - use customized BERT vocab/word-piece tokenization for baseline models as well as BERT
- additional corpora:
  - [AMI](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/annotation.shtml) -- has dialogue acts 
  - [SBCSAE](https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/research/santa-barbara-corpus#Intro)  -- normalize laughter & use for pre-training
- improve reporting and analysis:
  - macro F1 / macro precision? See: [Guillou et. al., 2016](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2345) (thanks, Sharid!)
  - majority class baseline 
  - time to train / number of parameters / task-trained parameters
  - laughter impact
    - story for laughter in each of the DAs
    - which pairs of DAs is laughter most helpful at distinguishing (i.e. in the confusion matrix, where is there the biggest decrease from NL -> L?)
    - counts for DAs (total, with/wo laughs)
- not super exciting but maybe we should try:
  - DAR model hyperparameter tuning (`hidden_size`, `n_layers`, `dropout`, `use_lstm`)
  - play with learning rate 
  - use the [BERT Adam optimiser](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT/blob/master/pytorch_pretrained_bert/optimization.py#L183) (implements a warm-up)
- probably future work: 
  - probing tasks of the hidden layer
    - predict dialogue end (or turns to end)
    - predict turn change
  - dialogue model pre-training
    - instead of training the dialogue model to predict DAs directly, predict the encoder representation of the next utterance (unsupervised)
    - test/probe by guessing DAs (or other discourse properties) with an additional linear layer
