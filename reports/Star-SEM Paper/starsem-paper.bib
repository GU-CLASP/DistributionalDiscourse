  abstract = {Pre-training models have been proved effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Inspired by this, we propose a novel dialogue generation pre-training framework to support various kinds of conversations, including chit-chat, knowledge grounded dialogues, and conversational question answering. In this framework, we adopt flexible attention mechanisms to fully leverage the bi-directional context and the uni-directional characteristic of language generation. We also introduce discrete latent variables to tackle with the natural born one-to-many mapping problem in response generation. Two reciprocal tasks of response generation and latent act recognition are designed and carried out simultaneously within a shared network. Comprehensive experiments on three publicly available datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Dialogue Act Recognition (DAR) is a challenging problem in dialogue interpretation, which aims to attach semantic labels to utterances and characterize the speaker's intention. Currently, many existing approaches formulate the DAR problem ranging from multi-classification to structured prediction, which suffer from handcrafted feature extensions and attentive contextual structural dependencies. In this paper, we consider the problem of DAR from the viewpoint of extending richer Conditional Random Field (CRF) structural dependencies without abandoning end-to-end training. We incorporate hierarchical semantic inference with memory mechanism on the utterance modeling. We then extend structured attention network to the linear-chain conditional random field layer which takes into account both contextual utterances and corresponding dialogue acts. The extensive experiments on two major benchmark datasets Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWDA) and Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act (MRDA) datasets show that our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art solutions to the problem. It is a remarkable fact that our method is nearly close to the human annotator's performance on SWDA within 2\% gap.},

However, moving towards multi-domain large-scale scenarios are shown to be difficult because the possible combinations of semantic inputs grow exponentially with the number of domains. To alleviate such scalability issue, we exploit the structure of dialog acts to build a multi-layer hierarchical graph, where each act is represented as a root-to-leaf route on the graph. Then, we incorporate such graph structure prior as an inductive bias to build a hierarchical disentangled self-attention network, where we disentangle attention heads to model designated nodes on the dialog act graph. By activating different (disentangled) heads at each layer, combinatorially many dialog act semantics can be modeled to control the neural response generation. On the large-scale Multi-Domain-WOZ dataset, our model can yield a significant improvement over the baselines on various automatic and human evaluation metrics.},

The scheme has three layers: Forward Communicative Functions, Backward Communicative Functions, and Utterance Features. Each layer allows multiple communicative functions of an utterance to be labeled. The Forward Communicative Functions consist of a taxonomy in a similar style as the actions of traditional speech act theory. The Backward Communicative Functions indicate how the current utterance relates to the previous dialog, such as accepting a proposal, con rming understanding, or answering a question. The Utterance Features include information about an utterance's form and content, such as whether an utterance concerns the communication process itself or deals with the subject at hand. The kappa inter-annotator reliability scores for the rst test of DAMSL with human annotators show promise, but are on average 0.15 lower than the accepted kappa scores for such annotations. However, the slight revisions to DAMSL discussed here should increase accuracy on the next set of tests and produce a reliable, exible, and comprehensive utterance annotation scheme.},

On the WMT'14 benchmarks, a single multilingual model achieves comparable performance for English\textrightarrow French and surpasses state-of-theart results for English\textrightarrow German. Similarly, a single multilingual model surpasses stateof-the-art results for French\textrightarrow English and German\textrightarrow English on WMT'14 and WMT'15 benchmarks, respectively. On production corpora, multilingual models of up to twelve language pairs allow for better translation of many individual pairs. Our models can also learn to perform implicit bridging between language pairs never seen explicitly during training, showing that transfer learning and zeroshot translation is possible for neural translation. Finally, we show analyses that hints at a universal interlingua representation in our models and also show some interesting examples when mixing languages.},

Structured Fusion Networks first learn neural dialog modules corresponding to the structured components of traditional dialog systems and then incorporate these modules in a higher-level generative model. Structured Fusion Networks obtain strong results on the MultiWOZ dataset, both with and without reinforcement learning.

In the sequence labeling tasks, the model input is a sequence, and the output is the label of the input sequence. The major difficulty of sequence labeling is that when the input sequence is long, it can include many noisy or irrelevant part. If the information in the whole sequence is treated equally, the noisy or irrelevant part may degrade the classification performance. The attention mechanism is helpful for sequence classification task because it is capable of highlighting important part among the entire sequence for the classification task. The experimental results show that with the attention mechanism, discernible improvements were achieved in the sequence labeling task considered here.

We show how speech acts and target referents can be modeled as sequential classification, and evaluate several techniques, exploiting contextualized word representations, semi-supervised learning, task dependencies and speaker meta-data.},

The input in this task is a sequence of utterances (i.e., conversational contributions) comprising a sequence of tokens, and the output is a sequence of DA labels (one label per utterance). Our model leverages the hierarchical nature of dialogue data by using two nested RNNs that capture long-range dependencies at the dialogue level and the utterance level. This model is combined with an attention mechanism that focuses on salient tokens in utterances. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms strong baselines on two popular datasets, Switchboard and MapTask; and our detailed empirical analysis highlights the impact of each aspect of our model.},

Instead of greedily choosing a label at each time step, and using it for the next prediction, we retain the probability distribution over the current label, and pass this distribution to the next prediction. This approach allows us to avoid the effect of label bias and error propagation in sequence learning/decoding. Our experiments on dialogue act classification demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. Even though our underlying neural network model is relatively simple, it outperforms more complex neural models, achieving state-of-the-art results on the MapTask and Switchboard corpora.},

In the first approach, Multi-Turn ESIM+ELMo (MT-EE), we incorporate pre-trained contextual embeddings into a sentence-pair model that was originally designed for natural language inference. In the second approach, we fine-tune the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) model. In the third approach, we fine-tune the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. Our results show that BERT performed best, followed by the GPT model and then the MTEE model. We also discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The submitted result for Track 1 (MT-EE) placed second and fifth overall for the Advising and Ubuntu datasets respectively.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) research have been dominated by the combination of Transfer Learning methods with large-scale language models, in particular based on the Transformer architecture. With them came a paradigm shift in NLP with the starting point for training a model on a downstream task moving from a blank specific model to a general-purpose pretrained architecture. Still, creating these general-purpose models remains an expensive and time-consuming process restricting the use of these methods to a small sub-set of the wider NLP community. In this paper, we present HuggingFace's Transformers library, a library for state-of-the-art NLP, making these developments available to the community by gathering state-of-the-art general-purpose pretrained models under a unified API together with an ecosystem of libraries, examples, tutorials and scripts targeting many downstream NLP tasks. HuggingFace's Transformers library features carefully crafted model implementations and high-performance pretrained weights for two main deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow, while supporting all the necessary tools to analyze, evaluate and use these models in downstream tasks such as text/token classification, questions answering and language generation among others. The library has gained significant organic traction and adoption among both the researcher and practitioner communities. We are committed at HuggingFace to pursue the efforts to develop this toolkit with the ambition of creating the standard library for building NLP systems.},
