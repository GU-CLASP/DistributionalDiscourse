We investigate the usefulness of BERT for dialogue act recognition.
We are interested in both how useful the pre-training procedure is and 
how well the model adapts to the dialogue domain.
To confirm that the fine-tuned model learns to represent dialogical features, 
we look at how it uses laughter, a phenomenon specific to dialogue.
